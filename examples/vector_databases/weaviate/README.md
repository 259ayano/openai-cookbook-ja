# Weaviate <> OpenAI

[â€‹Weaviate](https://weaviate.io) is an open-source vector search engine ([docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate) - [Github](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)) that can store and search through OpenAI embeddings _and_ data objects. The database allows you to do similarity search, hybrid search (the combining of multiple search techniques, such as keyword-based and vector search), and generative search (like Q&A). Weaviate also supports a wide variety of OpenAI-based modules (e.g., [`text2vec-openai`](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai), [`qna-openai`](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/qna-openai)), allowing you to vectorize and query data fast and efficiently.

You can run Weaviate (including the OpenAI modules if desired) in three ways:

1. Open source inside a Docker-container ([example](./docker-compose.yml))
2. Using the Weaviate Cloud Service ([get started](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart/installation#weaviate-cloud-service))
3. In a Kubernetes cluster ([learn more](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes))
