# Vector Databases

This section of the OpenAI Cookbook showcases many of the vector databases available to support your semantic search use cases.

Vector databases can be a great accompaniment for knowledge retrieval applications, which reduce hallucinations by providing the LLM with the relevant context to answer questions.

Each provider has their own named directory, with a standard notebook to introduce you to using our API with their product, and any supplementary notebooks they choose to add to showcase their functionality.
