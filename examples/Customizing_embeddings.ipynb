        "\n",
        "The input is training data in the form of [text_1, text_2, label] where label is +1 if the pairs are similar and -1 if the pairs are dissimilar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output is a matrix that you can use to multiply your embeddings. The product of this multiplication is a 'custom embedding' that will better emphasize aspects of the text relevant to your use case. In binary classification use cases, we've seen error rates drop by as much as 50%.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following example, I use 1,000 sentence pairs picked from the SNLI corpus. Each pair of sentences are logically entailed (i.e., one implies the other). These pairs are our positives (label = 1). We generate synthetic negatives by combining sentences from different pairs, which are presumed to not be logically entailed (label = -1).\n",
        "\n",
        "For a clustering use case, you can generate positives by creating pairs from texts in the same clusters and generate negatives by creating pairs from sentences in different clusters.\n",
