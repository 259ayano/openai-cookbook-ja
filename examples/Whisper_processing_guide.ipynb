    "# Enhancing Whisper transcriptions: pre- & post-processing techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook offers a guide to improve the Whisper's transcriptions. We'll streamline your audio data via trimming and segmentation, enhancing Whisper's transcription quality. After transcriptions, we'll refine the output by adding punctuation, adjusting product terminology (e.g., 'five two nine' to '529'), and mitigating Unicode issues. These strategies will help improve the clarity of your transcriptions, but remember, customization based on your unique use-case may be beneficial.\n",

    "\n",
    "To get started let's import a few different libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyDub](http://pydub.com/) is a simple and easy-to-use Python library for audio processing tasks such as slicing, concatenating, and exporting audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Audio` class from the `IPython.display` module allows you to create an audio control that can play sound in Jupyter notebooks, providing a straightforward way to play audio data directly in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For our audio file, we'll use a fictional earnings call written by ChatGPT and read aloud by the author.This audio file is relatively short, but hopefully provides you with an illustrative idea of how these pre and post processing steps can be applied to any audio file. "

Similarly, transform spoken numbers representing financial products into their numeric representations, followed by the full name of the product in parentheses. For instance, 'five two nine' to '529 (Education Savings Plan)' and 'four zero one k' to '401(k) (Retirement Savings Plan)'. However, be aware that some acronyms can have different meanings based on the context (e.g., 'LTV' can stand for 'Loan to Value' or 'Lifetime Value'). You will need to discern from the context which term is being referred to and apply the appropriate transformation.

      "Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus.

Our gross profit margin stands at a solid 58%, due in part to cost efficiencies gained from our scalable business model. Our EBITDA has surged to 37.5 million, translating to a remarkable 30% EBITDA margin. Our net income for the quarter rose to 16 million, which is a noteworthy increase from 10 million in Q2 2022. Our total addressable market has grown substantially thanks to the expansion of our high yield savings product line and the new RoboAdvisor platform. We've been diversifying our asset-backed securities portfolio, investing heavily in collateralized. debt obligations, and residential mortgage-backed securities. We've also invested $25 million in AAA rated corporate bonds, enhancing our risk adjusted returns. As for our balance sheet, total assets reached $1.5 billion with total liabilities at $900 million, leaving us with a solid equity base of $600 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our expansionary phase. We continue to see substantial organic user growth, with customer acquisition cost dropping by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%. Our LTVCAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5%. In terms of risk management, we have a value-at-risk model in place with a 99%... confidence level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed 5 million in the next trading day. We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage and have a healthy tier one capital ratio of 12.5%. Our forecast for the coming quarter is positive. We expect revenue to be around 135 million and 8% quarter over quarter growth driven primarily by our cutting edge blockchain solutions and AI driven predictive analytics. We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our FinTech subsidiary, Pay Plus, which we expect to raise 200 million.
