For example, if you want to add 1/4 and 2/3, you need to find a common denominator. One way to do this is to multiply the denominators together: 4 x 3 = 12. Then, you need to convert each fraction so that the denominator is 12. To do this, you can multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the same number. For example, to convert 1/4 to have a denominator of 12, you can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3: 1/4 x 3/3 = 3/12. To convert 2/3 to have a denominator of 12, you can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4: 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12. Now that both fractions have a denominator of 12, you can add them together: 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12.\n",
