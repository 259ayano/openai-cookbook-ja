    "# Whisper prompting guide\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's audio transcription API has an optional parameter called `prompt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt is intended to help stitch together multiple audio segments. By submitting the prior segment's transcript via the prompt, the Whisper model can use that context to better understand the speech and maintain a consistent writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, prompts do not need to be genuine transcripts from prior audio segments. _Fictitious_ prompts can be submitted to steer the model to use particular spellings or styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shares two techniques for using fictitious prompts to steer the model outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transcript generation**: GPT can convert instructions into fictitious transcripts for Whisper to emulate. \n",
    "- **Spelling guide**: A spelling guide can tell the model how to spell names of people, products, companies, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are not especially reliable, but can be useful in some situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with GPT prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting Whisper is not the same as prompting GPT. For example, if you submit an attempted instruction like \"Format lists in Markdown format\", the model will not comply, as it follows the style of the prompt, rather than any instructions contained within.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the prompt is limited to only 224 tokens. If the prompt is longer than 224 tokens, only the final 224 tokens of the prompt will be considered; all prior tokens will be silently ignored. The tokenizer used is the [multilingual Whisper tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py#L361).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get good results, craft examples that portray your desired style."

      "Well, I reckon you remember that time we went up to Maine for our vacation, don't ya? Boy, oh boy, what a trip that was! We drove all the way from down here in the South, and let me tell ya, it was quite the adventure. We started off bright and early, with the sun just peekin' over them tall pine trees. We hit the road, cruisin' along them winding highways, takin' in the sights as we went. I tell ya, the scenery up there was somethin' else. Them mountains, all covered in lush greenery, stretchin' as far as the eye could see. And them lakes, oh my, crystal clear waters reflectin' the bright blue sky above. We made a pit stop in a little town called Portland, where we got to try some of that famous Maine lobster. Now, I ain't never tasted anything quite like it. Fresh outta the ocean, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, I tell ya. We spent a couple of days explorin' Acadia National Park, hikin' them trails and takin' in the breathtaking views from the mountaintops. And let me tell ya, that ocean breeze sure did feel mighty fine on our skin. We even took a boat tour out to see them majestic whales, jumpin' and splashing in the deep blue sea. It was a sight to behold, my friend. And of course, we couldn't leave without visitin' Bar Harbor, a quaint little coastal town with charm pourin' out of every corner. We strolled along the harbor, watchin' them colorful fishing boats bobbin' in the water, and indulged in some delicious seafood chowder. Maine sure did steal a piece of our hearts, my friend. The memories we made on that trip will stay with us forever.\n"
